      Prevent <code class="command">CREATE SCHEMA</code> from defeating changes

      Within a <code class="command">CREATE SCHEMA</code> command, objects in the
      prevailing <code class="varname">search_path</code>, as well as those in the
      newly-created schema, would be visible even within a called

      having permission to create a schema to hijack the privileges of a

      Enforce row-level security policies correctly after inlining a

     </p><p>
      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling
      query, those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some
      cases involving re-using a cached plan under a different role.
      This could allow a user to see or modify rows that should have been
      invisible.

      Avoid crash when the new schema name is omitted

      name defaulting to <em class="replaceable"><code>owner_name</code></em>.  However

      Disallow altering composite types that are stored in indexes
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      <code class="command">ALTER TYPE</code> disallows non-binary-compatible
      modifications of composite types if they are stored in any table
      columns.  (Perhaps that will be allowed someday, but it hasn't
      happened yet; the locking implications of rewriting many tables are
      daunting.)  We overlooked the possibility that an index might
      contain a composite type that doesn't also appear in its table.

      Disallow system columns as elements of foreign keys (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Since the removal of OID as a system column, there is no plausible

      Disallow it rather than trying to fix all the cases.

      Ensure that <code class="command">COPY TO</code> from an RLS-enabled parent
      table does not copy any rows from child tables (Antonin Houska)
     </p><p>
      The documentation is quite clear that <code class="command">COPY TO</code>
      copies rows from only the named table, not any inheritance children
      it may have.  However, if row-level security was enabled on the table
      then this stopped being true.

      Fix error cursor setting for parse errors in JSON string literals
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Most cases in which a syntax error is detected in a string literal
      within a JSON value failed to set the error cursor appropriately.
      This led at least to an unhelpful error message (pointing to the
      token before the string, rather than the actual trouble spot), and
      could even result in a crash in v14 and later.

      Fix data corruption due to <code class="varname">vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</code>
      being larger than the current 64-bit xid (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>
      In v14 and later with non-default settings
      of <code class="varname">vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</code>, it was possible to
      compute a very large vacuum cleanup horizon xid, leading to vacuum
      removing rows that are still live.  v12 and v13 have a lesser form
      of the same problem affecting only GiST indexes, which could lead to
      index pages getting recycled too early.

      Fix parser's failure to detect some cases of improperly-nested

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Disable the inverse-transition optimization for window aggregates
      when the call contains sub-SELECTs (David Rowley)
     </p><p>
      This optimization requires that the aggregate's argument expressions
      have repeatable results, which might not hold for a sub-SELECT.

      Fix oversights in execution of nested <code class="literal">ARRAY[]</code>

     </p><p>
      Correctly detect overflow of the total space needed for the result
      array, avoiding a possible crash due to undersized output
      allocation.  Also ensure that any trailing padding space in the
      result array is zeroed; while leaving garbage there is harmless for
      most purposes, it can result in odd behavior later.

      (David Rowley)
     </p><p>
      Pruning with a condition like <code class="literal">boolcol IS NOT TRUE</code>
      was done incorrectly, leading to possibly not returning rows in
      which <code class="literal">boolcol</code> is NULL.  Also, the rather unlikely
      case of partitioning on <code class="literal">NOT boolcol</code> was handled
      incorrectly.

      In <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> isolation mode, the effects of
      a row update might need to get reapplied to a newer version of the
      row than the query found originally.  If so, we need to recompute

      Delay balancing is supposed to be disabled whenever autovacuum is

      Use of the syntax <code class="literal">INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET (c1,
      ...) = (SELECT ...)</code> with a partitioned target table could
      result in failure if any child table is dissimilar from the parent

      Such references are really lateral references, but the server could

     </p><p>
      Since the hash codes for enum values depend on the OIDs assigned to
      the enum, they are typically different after a dump and restore,
      meaning that rows often need to go into a different partition than
      they were in originally.  Users can work around that by specifying

      there is very little chance of success without that,
      teach <span class="application">pg_dump</span> to apply it automatically

     </p><p>
      Also, fix <span class="application">pg_restore</span> to not try
