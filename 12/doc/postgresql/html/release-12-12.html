      Do not let extension scripts replace objects not already belonging
      to the extension (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This change prevents extension scripts from doing <code class="command">CREATE
      OR REPLACE</code> if there is an existing object that does not
      belong to the extension.  It also prevents <code class="command">CREATE IF NOT
      EXISTS</code> in the same situation.  This prevents a form of
      trojan-horse attack in which a hostile database user could become
      the owner of an extension object and then modify it to compromise
      future uses of the object by other users.  As a side benefit, it
      also reduces the risk of accidentally replacing objects one did
      not mean to.
     </p><p>
      The <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> Project thanks
      Sven Klemm for reporting this problem.

      Fix replay of <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> WAL
      records on standby servers
      (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Asim R Praveen, Paul Guo)
     </p><p>
      Standby servers may encounter missing tablespace directories
      when replaying database-creation WAL records.  Prior to this
      patch, a standby would fail to recover in such a case;
      however, such directories could be legitimately missing.
      Create the tablespace (as a plain directory), then check that it
      has been dropped again once replay reaches a consistent state.

      Support <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">in place</span>”</span> tablespaces
      (Thomas Munro, Michael Paquier, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      Normally a Postgres tablespace is a symbolic link to a directory on
      some other filesystem.  This change allows it to just be a plain
      directory.  While this has no use for separating tables onto
      different filesystems, it is a convenient setup for testing.
      Moreover, it is necessary to support the <code class="command">CREATE
      DATABASE</code> replay fix, which transiently creates a missing
      tablespace as an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">in place</span>”</span> tablespace.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix permissions checks in <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> (Nathan
      Bossart, Noah Misch)
     </p><p>
      The fix for CVE-2022-1552 caused <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> to
      apply the table owner's permissions while performing lookups of
      operator classes and other objects, where formerly the calling
      user's permissions were used.  This broke dump/restore scenarios,
      because <span class="application">pg_dump</span> issues <code class="command">CREATE
      INDEX</code> before re-granting permissions.

      In extended query protocol, force an immediate commit
      after <code class="command">CREATE DATABASE</code> and other commands that
      can't run in a transaction block (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If the client does not send a Sync message immediately after such a
      command, but instead sends another command, any failure in that
      command would lead to rolling back the preceding command, typically
      leaving inconsistent state on-disk (such as a missing or extra
      database directory).  The mechanisms intended to prevent that
      situation turn out to work for multiple commands in a simple-Query
      message, but not for a series of extended-protocol messages.  To
      prevent inconsistency without breaking use-cases that work today,
      force an implicit commit after such commands.

      Fix race condition when checking transaction visibility (Simon Riggs)
     </p><p>
      <code class="function">TransactionIdIsInProgress</code> could
      report <code class="literal">false</code> before the subject transaction is
      considered visible, leading to various misbehaviors.  The race
      condition window is normally very narrow, but use of synchronous
      replication makes it much wider, because the wait for a synchronous
      replica happens in that window.

      Fix queries in which a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">whole-row variable</span>”</span> references

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

      In certain cases, a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trigger does not exist</span>”</span> failure
      would occur because the command would try to adjust the trigger on a
      child partition that doesn't have it.

      Ensure that <code class="function">pg_stop_backup()</code> cleans up session

      Fix join alias matching in <code class="literal">FOR [KEY] UPDATE/SHARE</code>

      Avoid crashing if too many column aliases are attached to

      Reject <code class="literal">ROW()</code> expressions and functions
      in <code class="literal">FROM</code> that have too many columns (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Cases with more than about 1600 columns are unsupported, and
      have always failed at execution.  However, it emerges that some
      earlier code could be driven to assertion failures or crashes by
      queries with more than 32K columns.  Add a parse-time check to
      prevent that.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      When decompiling a view or rule, show a <code class="command">SELECT</code>
      output column's <code class="literal">AS "?column?"</code> alias clause
      if it could be referenced elsewhere (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Previously, this auto-generated alias was always hidden; but there
      are corner cases where doing so results in a non-restorable view or
      rule definition.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix dumping of a view using a function in <code class="literal">FROM</code>
      that returns a composite type, when column(s) of the composite type
      have been dropped since the view was made (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This oversight could lead to dump/reload
      or <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> failures, as the dumped
      view would have too many column aliases for the function.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Report implicitly-created operator families to event triggers
      (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      If <code class="command">CREATE OPERATOR CLASS</code> results in the implicit
      creation of an operator family, that object was not reported to
      event triggers that should capture such events.

      Fix control file updates made when a restartpoint is running during
      promotion of a standby server (Kyotaro Horiguchi)
     </p><p>
      Previously, when the restartpoint completed it could incorrectly
      update the last-checkpoint fields of the control file, potentially
      leading to PANIC and failure to restart if the server crashes before
      the next normal checkpoint completes.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Prevent triggering of
      standby's <code class="varname">wal_receiver_timeout</code> during logical
      replication of large transactions (Wang Wei, Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>
      If a large transaction on the primary server sends no data to the
      standby (perhaps because no table it changes is published), it was
      possible for the standby to timeout.  Fix that by ensuring we send
      keepalive messages periodically in such situations.

      Allow custom server parameters to have short descriptions that are
      NULL (Steve Chavez)
     </p><p>
      Previously, although extensions could choose to create such

      Arrange to clean up after commit-time errors
      within <code class="function">SPI_commit()</code>, rather than expecting
      callers to do that (Peter Eisentraut, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Proper cleanup is complicated and requires use of low-level
      facilities, so it's not surprising that no known caller got it
      right.  This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure
      issued <code class="command">COMMIT</code> but a failure occurred (such as a
      deferred constraint check).  To improve matters,
      redefine <code class="function">SPI_commit()</code> as starting a new
      transaction, so that it becomes equivalent
      to <code class="function">SPI_commit_and_chain()</code> except that you get
      default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior
      transaction's characteristics.  To make this somewhat transparent
      API-wise, redefine <code class="function">SPI_start_transaction()</code> as a
      no-op.  All known callers of <code class="function">SPI_commit()</code>
      immediately call <code class="function">SPI_start_transaction()</code>, so
      they will not notice any change.  Similar remarks apply
      to <code class="function">SPI_rollback()</code>.
     </p><p>
      Also fix PL/Python, which omitted any handling of such errors at all,
      resulting in jumping out of the Python interpreter.  This is
      reported to crash Python 3.11.  Older Python releases leak some
      memory but seem okay with it otherwise.

      Remove misguided SSL key file ownership check
      in <span class="application">libpq</span> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      In the previous minor releases, we copied the server's permission
      checking rules for SSL private key files into libpq.  But we should
      not have also copied the server's file-ownership check.  While that
      works in normal use-cases, it can result in an unexpected failure
      for clients running as root, and perhaps in other cases.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Ensure <span class="application">ecpg</span> reports server connection loss
      sanely (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Misprocessing of a libpq-generated error result, such as a report of
      lost connection, would lead to printing <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">(null)</span>”</span>
      instead of a useful error message; or in older releases it would
      lead to a crash.

      Avoid core dump in <span class="application">ecpglib</span> with
      unexpected orders of operations (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Certain operations such as <code class="command">EXEC SQL PREPARE</code> would
      crash (rather than reporting an error as expected) if called before
      establishing any database connection.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In <span class="application">ecpglib</span>, avoid
      redundant <code class="function">newlocale()</code> calls (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>
      Allocate a C locale object once per process when first connecting,
      rather than creating and freeing locale objects once per query.
      This mitigates a libc memory leak on AIX, and may offer some
      performance benefit everywhere.
